# Solving Advent of Code 2022 with Enso

<!-- Put an image here -->

Some members of the team building [Enso](https://enso.org/) decided to try and tackle last year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) using the language and see how far we could get. I've previously tried [solving Advent of Code in Alteryx](https://jdunkerley.co.uk/2020/12/05/alteryxing-the-advent-of-code-2020-week-1/) and was personally interested to see whether it easier or harder with what we are building.

For those not familiar with the Advent of Code, every year [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl) creates a set or 25 programming puzzles posted one a day over December. Each puzzle has two related parts with a set of test values and results for both parts. Often the second part is harder extension of the first part. Generally, there should be a solution which can complete within a few seconds (although we didn't always find that one!).

This post summarises a few of the puzzles we tried and some of the challenges we faced.
